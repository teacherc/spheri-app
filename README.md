## Description

Spheri is a web app that uses local weather information to generate song recommendations. Someone experiencing thundersnow can expect a different recommendation than someone experiencing clear conditions at 72℉.

Link to the deployed web app: https://spheri.app/

### Motivation

I was the ten-year-old who begged to stay up past 11 pm so I could watch meteorologist Steve Pool talk about El Niño, dew points, and the jet stream. Even though I did not take up meterology as an adult, the weather has a big impact on my mood. I wanted to create something that would help me find new music that matches whatever weather vibes I'm experiencing.

This app solves a problem my wife and I have. There is so much music on Spotify, that it's hard to choose which new songs to listen to. I find myself listening to the same playlists over and over again.

### Learning

I also built this project so I could cement my Python, Flask, git/GitHub, Bootstrap, APIs, unit testing, and Google Cloud deployment skills.

```

## Installation

If you want to see how the app looks to users, you can visit [http://spheri.app]

To run in a local environment:

1. Fork the code
2. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (if you need to install Python 3.x, visit [https://www.python.org/downloads/]):

```shell
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Update `pip` and install the required dependencies:

```shell
(venv) $ pip install -U pip
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a '''config.py''' file with the proper keys

- Create a new app at [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications].
- Create a '.env' file
- Fill in the client id and client secret:
```python
CLIENT_ID=''
CLIENT_SECRET=''
```
- Sign up for a free WeatherStack API account [https://weatherstack.com/product]
- Add your WeatherStack access key to the .env file:
```python
ACCESS_KEY=''
CLIENT_ID=''
CLIENT_SECRET=''
```

5. Start the Flask server:

```shell
(venv) $ python main.py
 * Serving Flask app "main" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
 * Restarting with stat
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 339-986-221
 ```

 6. Open a browser to the specified local address and port (Usually http://127.0.0.1:8080/). Voila! 

## Tests

Tests are located in ```tests/test_main.py```. After you create your virtual environment and install the required packages, you can run ```test_main.py```. 

## Usage

A user can enter a valid U.S. zipcode, submit the zipcode, and receive a readout of local weather conditions as well as a song recommendation (via Spotify's recommendation API). A 30-second preview of the song can be accessed via the player. If a user clicks on the album art or the artist link, the corresponding Spotify track page will open.

- Many thanks to my Code Mentor Greg [https://www.codementor.io/@ggorlen]. I had a thorny design issue because I didn't know I was going to use Flask when I started the project. Greg gave me strategies for how to refactor my existing code to include Flask. I was able to do the rest of the project without issues after a few pointers.
